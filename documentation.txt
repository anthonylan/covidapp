##EDITING AFFILIATE LINKS
For editing the Amazon affilate products which is found at index.html)
If you go through the HTML page(index.html) you'll see a comment like this:  
<!--========================== Affiliate Products ============================ -->

Below that lies the affilate links, you can change their text, images and links.

The affiliate links looks like this:

   <a href="https://amzn.to/2x1YAzF" target="_blank">
       <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91QCnvvW5YL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="">
       <p>Swiss Safe 2-in-1 First Aid Kit</p>
  </a>


This is how you edit them:

   <a href="<[AFFILIATE LINK GOES HERE]>" target="_blank">
        <img src="<[PRODUCT IMAGE GOES HERE]>" alt="">
       <p><[PRODUCT TITLE GOES HERE]></p>
   </a>


 The same thing if you want to add more products, you just have copy the above and replace the link, title and image  




 //// FOR DEVELOPER

Remember the site uses Webpack for the JavaScript and Saas for the CSS. So if you have to make any changes to the index.scss file you'll need a compiler for it to take effect.
I use Prepros for compiling, but you can use any.
 For make chan take effect on the index.js file you'll need to run the Webpack command: 'npm run start'
 that will bundle update the main.js file in the /dist folder.

The file vendor.js and vendor.css are very important for the Toilet paper calculator to work, so do not delete, 
in short do not delete any file that has a .js, .scss, .css extention, in short do not delete anything lol

 The site logo can be found in the folder /assets/img
